Web Programming with Python and JavaScript

For all the files there will be the same navigation bar which is used from bootstrap and I have used the active class to tell the user which link in the navigation is currently active. Also, all the text on the website is from google fonts and the font that is used is manrope along with the weight of this being 200. To ensure that all the text on the webpage has the same style I have created a class called text and I have used scss to ensure that the other classes and ids on the page inherit this. All of the files have the same format with a main heading and some content below this.

index.html: This is the home page for this website. The main contains of this page are the welcome message and the image of me when I was younger. The image has a link around it which will take the user to the direct route of the image with it being opened in a new tab using the target attribute which is set to blank and it is styled so when the user hovers over the image it turns grey to add animation to the website.
