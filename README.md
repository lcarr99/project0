Web Programming with Python and JavaScript

For all the files there will be the same navigation bar which is used from bootstrap and I have used the active class to tell the user which link in the navigation is currently active. Also, all the text on the website is from google fonts and the font that is used is manrope along with the weight of this being 200. To ensure that all the text on the webpage has the same style I have created a class called text and I have used scss to ensure that the other classes and ids on the page inherit this. All of the files have the same format with a main heading and some content below this. All the page of the website have a sky blue background

index.html:- This is the home page for this website. The main contents of this page are the welcome message and the image of me when I was younger. The image has a link around it which will take the user to the direct route of the image with it being opened in a new tab using the target attribute which is set to blank and it is styled so when the user hovers over the image it turns grey to add animation to the website.

biography.html:- This is the page that has a mini write up about me. It has been done using lorem ipsum to save myself some time

Interests.html:- This is the page that is about some of my interests. I have included a table and an unordered list on this page and I have also taken advantage of bootstrap components in order to style the table

projects.html:- In this page I have taken advantage of the column layout in bootstrap and i've used three columns. The description has been done in lorem ipsum again in order to save myself time.

style.scss:- This is the scss file that I have used to style everything on the page. In this file I have many different methods of scss such as inheritance, nesting and variables in order to make my stylesheet much more clean and I have managed to save myself time in the process of doing this

style.css.map:- This is the file that will compile the scss into css. The software that has been used to compile the scss is the koala

style.css:- This is the css file that styles the page and all the code in this file has been compiled from style.scss
